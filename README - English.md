# Introduction to a programmable dataplane

Welcome to this tutorial introducing you to the principle of a programmable dataplane.
Following this tutorial, you will get to know the programming language `P4` and see how you can implement your own simple dataplane, as well as connect it to a control plane.
In a more complex situation, this controller can be `ONOS`; to which example you will be solely introduced (and there is noted where you can try this on your own).
Because the programmable dataplane can be combined with SDN, we will shortly revisit this topic.

_Note: While this is an introduction to the language of P4, you will not write your own code._
_For this, other tutorials are available (which I will refer to)._
_This folder also contains a powerpoint which gives a short explanation of what the programmable dataplane entails._


##### Expected knowledge #####
This tutorial can be seen as a sequel to my SDN tutorial, also available on GitHub.
While you should be able to understand this tutorial without SDN knowledge, I advise you to also invest som etime to understand SDN to truly see what possibilities all these technologies bring.
CLI knowledge is also a pr√©.

## Preparation <a name="voorbereiding"></a>
When following this tutorial, you are given a virtual image which you can import into `VirtualBox`.
On this virtual machine, all needed software and code is available such you can directly dive into the material.
All important code is also available here in this GitHub folder, such that you can also reed the code when you don't have the virtual machine running.
If you get a reference to this tutorial and don't have the virtual image, please contact me.
